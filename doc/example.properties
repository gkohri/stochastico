# Data paramters

# demands on the data. Nevertheless, it still needs to know a few things about 
# the data in order to proceed.
# 
# The name of the file containing training data.

# Line numbers of any lines in the file to be skipped. (E.g., a header line.)

# indicated using a dash: 1,3,5-7. Numbering starts with 1.

# In the latter case the quotation marks are mandatory.
