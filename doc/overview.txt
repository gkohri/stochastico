 *          Stochastico is an open source implementation of stochastic 
 *          discrimination (SD).  SD is a machine learning algorithm used 
 *          for categorization, pattern recognition and predictive modeling.
 *          It is the most general algorithm in the ensemble learning class
 *          of algorithms.
 *
 *          This software is an early release alpha version.  
 *          See the src/test/resources directory for a list of the data 
 *          sets on which this software has been successfully tested.
